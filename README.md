## Setup of Dev Environment

The environment is set up using docker, so you can just get started immediately without jumping through hoops to set up environments.

The tools you need installed in your environment are the latest version of `docker` and `docker-compose`

Note, the instructions assume you are working from a unix/linux based system.

To get the docker environment to run locally, the following steps need to be taken.

1. rename the `env.example` file to `.env`

2. while in the root directory, run the following command, which will start all the services and set them to the background:
    * `docker-compose up --build -d`
3. go into the running app container, `api_boiler_plate` and run `composer install`. You only need to run these whenever composer.json changes, or you delete the vendor directory. As a matter of principle, I try to run this every time I do a pull and start the app. To go into the container and use composer, do the following:
    * `docker-compose exec api_boiler_plate bash`
    * `composer install`
Alternatively, you do not have to go into any of the containers to do this, you can run the command directly from docker-compose, the following can work for you.
    * `docker-compose exec api_boiler_plate composer install`

4. the webserver and mysql database can be accessed at the following endpoints and ports:
    * api: __localhost:8090__
    * database:
        * location: __localhost:3306__
        * username: __root__
        * password: __api_user__
    note, that these are default values and are actually set as environment variables that are picked up by both the app and the database. See `docker-compose.yaml` for more information about all of these.
5. Enjoy testing.

As you make changes, the changes are reflected, while testing.

If you want to go into a running container, whether te webserver or the database, the following commands using docker-compose will help.

```bash
docker-compose exec api bash # this is for the api app
docker-compose exec database bash # this is for the database
docker-compose exec redis bash # this is for the redis server
```

There are many reasons you might want to go into the containers, i.e run some commands, check logs etc

### Migration

For first time installation, after successful start of the containers, you ll need to go into the app container with the command `docker-compose exec api_boiler_plate bash` and run the following :
* `php artisan migrate`
* `php artisan passport:install --uuid`  this will prompt for the re run of the migration
* `php artisan db:seed`
